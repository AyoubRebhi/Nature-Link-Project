# 🌍 NatureLink

NatureLink is a **cloud-native application** that integrates **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, automation, monitoring, and **AI models** for intelligent recommendations and content generation.  

It demonstrates **end-to-end deployment on OpenStack**, automated with **Ansible**, containerized with **Docker & Kubernetes**, and monitored with **Prometheus & Grafana**.  

The application combines a **Spring Boot backend** with an **Angular frontend**, and integrates multiple **AI models** (LLM, NLP, CNN, Logistic Regression, Transformers, and DALL·E).
